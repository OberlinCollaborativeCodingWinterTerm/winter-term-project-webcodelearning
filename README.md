# Code Learning Website

## Group Members: 
Duy Le

## Project idea: 
A LeetCode-like website for beginners to be used to basic code ideas like conditional, loops, and functions. 

## Full Stack Website:
The website is built *almost* full-stack (I deployed both front-end and back-end using JavaScript, with ReactJS and ExpressJS, and save the database by the platform Atlas MongoDB).
- *The code grader is based partly on [another API](https://github.com/Jaagrav/CodeX-API), which is **only used to run Python code on the server**. Other parts are deployed by me, Duy Le.*

## Website: 
I did deployed the website to the Internet using the *free* service [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), and the website is [duycodeweb.fly.dev](https://duycodeweb.fly.dev).

## Front-end:
As you can see, this website use **build**, which is React optimised protected build for front-end. The full code for front-end could be found [here](https://github.com/duylevietluu/winter-2023-project-frontend).

## Special thanks
- Thank you to the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) for teaching me the basics of full-stack developing, which grants me knowledge to build this whole website. 
    - *Although my code does use some patterns that I learn from this course, I, in no way, copy the code/structure straight from the course. I come up with the database structures by myself!*
- Thank you to Jaagrav's [CodeX API](https://github.com/Jaagrav/CodeX-API), which I used for executing Python code in the server.
